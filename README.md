A simple Flutter application that simulates rolling a dice. When the user taps the "Roll" button, the dice generates a random number between 1 and 6, and updates the displayed dice image accordingly. This project serves as an introduction to Flutter app structure, widget usage, random number generation, and handling dynamic UI updates.
